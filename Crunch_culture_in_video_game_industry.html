  <part>The Crunch culture in the video game industry</part>
  <p>
    	It is well known that in the video game industry, the working conditions
      are, to phrase it kindly, not the best. Today things start to change as we
      can see with the recent scandal in Ubisoft about toxic behavior and toxic
      management or some years ago with the scandal in Quantic Dream. Every year
      there is a new scandal. In 2020 it was CD PROJEKT RED with the development
      of their very awaited game Cyberpunk 2077. In all these affairs, there is
      one word that comes back regularly: “Crunch”. In this article we will see
      what is this managerial method, what are its consequences and what is done
      about it

  </p>

  <part> What is the Crunch</part>
  <p>
    There is not a clear definition of what is a Crunch but we can phrase it that
    way:
  it’s a period of time, often before a due date, during which the company asks
  their employees to do mandatory overtimes.
  	The Crunch is not specific to the video game industry, but it is an
    important part of it. This is why some people speak about a Crunch Culture
    in video games. Some studios see it as an integral part of their management.
    The studio Bioware, for example, speaks about “Bioware Magic”.

     style="width:500px; height:300px;">
  </div>
  <p>
    Studios like Naughty Dog is also known for numerous Crunches during the
    development of their games.
  </p>

     style="width:500px; height:300px;">

    		Some could think that this Crunch culture is a consequence of the recent
        transformation of the industry. With big corporations making games
        involving billions of dollars and hundreds of employees. But I’m sorry
        to say that this is not that easy. We can find examples of crunches in
        games like Super Metroid in 1994 or ET in 1982. This phenomenon is not
        new and it can be very damaging.

  <part> Origin and porblems of the Crunch </part>
<p>
	Crunches can happened during long periods of time and can blow out of
  proportion really fast. In an article from “Game industry.biz” a developer of
  Neather Realm speaks about 90 hours work by week and this is not without
  consequences on the health of the employees with Burnout etc.

</p>
<p>
	And that doesn’t stop there. This culture is one of the reasons why the average
  age of the employees is so low. This industry attracts many young workers and
  many of them won’t stay long, whether it be because of the numerous layoffs,
  their working conditions or health problems.
</p>
<p>

	And this won’t change easily. First, because this Crunch culture is in place
  for years. It’s a relic of the time where video games creators where some
  passionate students in a garage. Even today, the argument of the passion is
  often put forward to justify the great pressure put on by the studios or by
  the employees themselves. These bad working conditions are a real godsend for
  the big Corporations. But this is also really present in the world of
  “indie games” (independent games). Method like “Crunch” are institutionalized.
  Many people think that Crunching is indispensable to create good games and the
  Crunch is even taught in video games schools. These schools don’t hesitate to
  encourage their students to stay late to work on their projects with kitchens
  in the tutorials rooms and heavy workloads.


</p>

  <part> What are the solutions </part>
  <p>

	But, things are slowly evolving. Recently, we have seen the creation of trade
  union to protect the rights of the workers in the video game industry. There
  are also little studios, like motion twin, which try to be more horizontal and
  so limiting the number of Crunch during the development. And these initiatives
  are successful. In 2018, Motion Twin released Dead cells which became the game
  of the year.

   style="width:500px; height:300px;">
</div>
</p>

<p>
It’s also really important that people at large are aware of this. Because, by
encouraging little initiatives and criticize bad behaviours, maybe, we will be
able to change this horrible culture that has clung to the video game industry
for so many years
