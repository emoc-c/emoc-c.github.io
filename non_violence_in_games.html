  <part>Speaking of violence in video games</part>
  <p>
    	If there is one thing we find everywhere in video games and in our society
      in general, it is violence. Violence is a fantastic tool to create stakes,
      developing characters or create simply understandable rules. But if movies
      and books use it all the time, video games often encounter a lot more
      criticism about their depiction of violence. So let’s speak about pacifism
      in video games for once. Let’s see how video games criticize violence.
      There are many ways to transmit this idea, by the story, by the graphics
      or by the gameplay. But, of course, we will see that it is often a
      combination of this three elements.

  </p>

  <part>I Let Players the choice</part>
  <p>
  When we speak about pacifism in video games, there is one name that comes over
  and over again: Undertale.
  </p>
  <div>
  <img class="img"
     src="img/non_violence_in_games/undertale_title.png"
     alt = ""
     style="width:500px; height:300px;">
  </div>
  <p>
    In this game, the player has globally two choices during every battle:<br>
    -Using the combat system as in every RPG (choose an attack, choose a target,
    attack, repeat) <br>
    -Using the mercy button to discuss with the monster and try to end the fight
    peacefully (often by solving a little puzzle around the monster’s name which
    is often a wordplay).
  </p>

  <div>
  <img class="img"
     src="img/non_violence_in_games/undertale_combat_system.jpg"
     alt="undertale combat system"
     style="width:500px; height:300px;">

  <div><q>Undertale combat window</q></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    	But, unlike many games which let you, at some scripted moments, choose
      between violence or pacifism, Undertale lets this choice at every time. In
      each combat, at each turn, the player get the possibility to attack or
      bargain with each enemy. Here, pacifism is a full part of the combat
      system.
  <div>
		Add to this that each enemy is different. Some will attack you and will need
    to be attacked before they agree to listen to you and others won’t attack
    you at all and will just be sitting there, waiting for the end of their
    turn. This system is really interesting and offers some really funny and
    unexpected ways to interact with the NPCs.
  </div>
  </p>
  <div>
  <img class="img"
     src="img/non_violence_in_games/undertale_date_interface.jpg"
     alt="undertale_interface"
     style="width:500px; height:300px;">
  </div>
<p>
	But the possibility to be non violent is not enough. To make things
  interesting, the universe must react to your actions. In Undertale, killing a
  monster will grant you upgrades, Exp, gold and LOVE while sparing the enemy
  won’t reward you at all. BUT, killing monsters will force you to play across
  numerous combat and every NPC will try to kill you. On the other hand, if you
  spare everyone, the game will be more complex because each combat will become
  a puzzle were you’ll must speak with the enemy, discover their stories and
  befriend them to end the fight peacefully.

</p>
<p>
	Like this, Undertale will recompense violent players with short term bonuses
  but they will have to face the consequences of the actions, falling inside an
  endless circle of violence with more combats and the entire world against them.
  However, the pacifist player will be rewarded in the end by a more complex
  story, more character development, fantastic encounters and a memorable final
  combat in the underworld.
</p>
<p>

	So the game offers the player to be peaceful and this action is completely
  incorporated inside the combat system. Moreover, the world will react to your
  action by changing the behaviour of the NPCs to match with your game style. But
  the really interesting part is that the game let you the choice. You are not
  forced to spare every monster, in fact, the game uses the specific codes of
  the RPG genre to orient your actions. In every game when you play well, the
  games rewards you, that’s how you know if your winning or not. But in Undertale
  the only way for you to get a reward is by killing everyone. Because of this,
  playing peacefully is much more harder cause it will force you to act against
  your instinct and can feel like your playing against the rules. In the end,
  what the game says is that pacisfism is not easy but is the best way to solve
  conflicts and with all we just discuss, I think we can all agree that it says
  that in an interesting way that only video games can offer.


</p>

<part> II The abscence of choice, non Judgmental Gameplay and feeling </part>

<p>
  But there is an other way to denounce violence in a video game which is, in my
  opinion, very interesting. For this, I will take Borderlands 2 as an example
  <div>
    <img class="img"
       src="img/non_violence_in_games/borderlands_2.jpg"
       alt="borderlands_2_title"
       style="width:500px; height:300px;">
  </div>
 In this game, killing is fun. You run everywhere shooting everything, running
 from cover to cover, corpse to corpse to get ammos and crazy weapons while
 every NPCs are shouting at you ridiculous insults. But when it’s done, when you
 have shot the last enemy in the room, the game changes suddenly its tone. During
 this moment, you are alone, in gigantic places corpses scattered all around with
 just the sound of the wind and sometimes the insane laugh of the person who asks
 you to kill all these people.

</p>
  <p>

	This alone is pretty deranging but the game doesn’t stop there. In the
  borderlands everybody is a dangerous maniac killer. Each mission asks you to
  kill something. This is the only way you can interact with the world and at
  first, it’s also the only way the world uses to speak back. When NPCs don’t
  attack you, they ask you to kill someone or they offer you weapons and ammos.
  But in the end, it’s worthless. If there is one thing that the story and the
  gameplay say, it’s that you don’t solve anything like that, that all you are
  doing is not helpful.
</p>

<p>
  So how does this work ? How this game shows the player its cynical vision of
  violence. First, the game doesn’t let the player the occasion to think about
  it. The game is fundamentally a FPS which means that all you are doing is
  shooting people in the face with various weapons in various environment. And
  the game knows that. Every character you will meet is a dangerous killer on
  the edge of madness in a logic of “always more”. You are not the good guy
  who’s here to save everybody, you are a murderer that kills other murderers to
  help a third murderer. But each character has a reason to be this way.
  Sometimes it is a stupid reason like “yeah I want to find a name for this
  creature so bring me a bunch of corpses of them to inspire me” to very more
  tragic reasons like “they sold my parents to buy food so I want to blow them
  up during my tea party”. And each mission will not ultimately solve the
  problem. If you save someone, you will probably find its corpse during an
  other mission, if you kill a group of cannibals, they will reform as soon as
  you left the place. In the story, every time you try to weaken the big evil
  corporation, they will answer you with more violence, more weapons and more
  power. The story is just about an endless cycle of vengeance which will not be
  solved at the end because of the nature of the borderlands. Once you have
  killed Handsome Jack, the corporation lands will fall back in the hand of
  immoral settlers or deranged bandits. From the beginning the game makes you
  understand that you will never really win.

</p>

<p>
		This is even more visible in the gameplay. The main gameplay mechanic is
    that every weapon is procedural. So every time you find a powerful weapon,
    there is a chance that the game will create, somewhere, an ever deadly and
    powerful one. At the same time, the game treats your actions very strangely.
    It is an open world in which you can find enemy bases. These bases can’t be
    captured. Of course you can attack them but even if you kill every one inside,
    they will reappear the next time you will come. When we speak about slaughters,
    the game doesn’t seem to care. which trends to makes your actions meaningless,
    and at the same time, this massacres don’t feel like a big deal. You don’t
    have to bother you about the consequences. In video games, each action is
    motivated by a reward. That can be statistics boost, fragment of stories or
    items. Due to this, every interaction as a meaning. If you want an action
    feels important, you must balance its consequences as such. For example, a
    once-playable mission will force the player to think twice before starting it.
    But here, to attack a camp will grant you weapons and money without many
    risks. Because of this, the fact of attacking a camp and killing its
    occupants doesn’t matters. With these mechanics, the game makes sure that you
    are never done with the violence and pushes you to willingly fights,
    sometimes for nothing.

         alt="borderlands_fight"
         style="width:500px; height:300px;">
    </div>
</p>

<p>
  	With its twisted moral, its funny characters, and overwhelming violence,
    Borderlands 2 makes the player enjoying violence and shows him the
    consequences of it. With this overall “killing is fun” feeling, all this
    moments of contemplation after a slaughter or these really dark backstorie
    make an abrupt change of tone in the middle of this colorful and gory mess
    that is Borderlands 2. And I think that this feeling is amplified by the
    fact that you are directly acting in the game. It is no more making you
    philosophy about an imaginary character, but about you as a player and your
    actions. The game tells you, by it's gameplay, that you are not different
    from all the terrible persons you have encounter during your adventure. And,
    in the end, if you learn one thing from the Borderlands, it’s that violence
    will always generate more violence and more pain.

<part>Conclusion</part>

<p>
  		With these two examples, We have seen two ways to speak about violence in
      video games. One oriented on your own choices, in which the game shows you
      the consequences of your actions. these games play with you. They force you
      to play aggressively and at the same time, makes pacifism a difficult choice
      you are not forced to make. Others games force you to be violent and immoral
      and makes you enjoying it before showing you the consequences of your
      terrible actions. But these two methods are not perfect, they have their
      downsides. The first can be tricky to implement because it asks you to
      write all the different endings. The other one is much more subtle and can
      be completely ignored by the player if it is badly implemented. And you ?
      How would you use the fantastic medium that is the video game to treats
      those complex subjects?
