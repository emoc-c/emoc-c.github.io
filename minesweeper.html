  If you have ever used a computer then you have probably played Minesweeper. For those who don’t know what is it, Minesweeper is one of the most popular game in the world and it was installed on every computer under windows. In this game you have an array of cells and each one contain a mine or the number of mine around it, at the beginning of the game you don’t know what is inside the cells, clicking on a cell shows what is inside it, if it’s a bomb you lost. The goal of the game is to return all the cells expect the bombs.
In this article we will travel in the past to discover the story of one of the most popular game of all time.

  <part>history</part>
  <p>
  Minesweeper takes his origines in the 60‘s and the 70’s, at this time the only places where you could find a computer were research centers and big companies. In 1973, Jerimac Ratliff a pragrammer from Fort Worth in Texas created Cube, this video game where you travel on the edges of a cube form the point (1,1,1) to the point (3,3,3) whithout touching a mine is considered as the older ancestor of Minesweeper.

  <p>
  The crazister thing about Cube is that we don’t know a lot of things about his creator Jerimac Ratliff,we don’t know his age and what he is doing now, it’s even impossible to find a picture of him on the Internet.
Cube is the first « puzzle » video game ever made, and this type of game became very popular in the 80’s with games like Mined-out by Quicksilva in 1983 a game where you have to cross a minefield or Yomp by Virgin Interactive in 1983.

  At the same time Curt Johnson a Microsoft employee was creating the first version of a game inspiered by Mined-out and Cube, one of his colleage Richard Donner wanted to learn programmation under Windows, so he asked for the source code of Curt Johnson’s game to train his pragramming skills, Richard Donner was not a very good graphist but he had the idea to add a smiley to Mr Johnson’s game to give to the player an instant feedback(if you click on a mine the smiley is mad) .Then Richard Donner sent the game with the name Winmine to his boss but it has been renamed Minesweeper and has been published in the Windows 3.0 Entertainment Pack in 1990. In 1992 Minesweeper has been included in every computer under Window 3.1.

  In 2006, Microsoft published a new version of Minesweeper called Flower Garden after the raise of a lot of controversies against the game in some area where landmines is a touchy subject. In Flower Garden mines has been replaced by flowers

  Minesweeper is available in 3 levels of difficulty: beginners(10 mines, 8x8 grid), intermediate(40 mines, 3x15 to 16x16 grid) and expert(99 mines, 16x30 mines).
Every level of difficulty has his recordman,the fastest player to beat the game. For now,the record of each level is owned by Kamil Murański a polish player (beginners:0,49 secondes , intermediate :7,03 secondes and expert:31,133 secondes). 
Minesweeper is very addictive and one of the most addict player is Bill Gates him self! He is the first humain to finish the beginner level under 4 secondes! My personnal record for this level is 13 secondes (I am not really good at this game). So you know all the history of this mythic game! You can play Minesweeper online and try to beat Bill Gates‘ record !
